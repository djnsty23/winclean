# Windows 11 Optimizer

A comprehensive, user-friendly tool to optimize Windows 11 performance, privacy, and disk space.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click **"Apply Recommended Settings"** or select manually
3. Click "Generate My Optimizer"
4. Download all 3 files (downloads automatically):
   - `START_HERE_Windows_Optimizer.bat` - **Run this one!**
   - `Windows_Optimizer_OneTime.ps1` (used automatically)
   - `Windows_Optimizer_Scheduled.ps1` (used automatically)
5. **Keep all 3 files in the same folder**
6. **Right-click `START_HERE_Windows_Optimizer.bat`** > **Run as Administrator**
7. Select from the interactive menu

**IMPORTANT**: Only run the START_HERE .bat file! The .ps1 files are used automatically.

## How It Works

### 1. Generate Your Custom Optimizer
- Open `index.html` in any browser
- Use **Quick Actions**:
  - **Apply Recommended Settings** - Instantly selects all safe, recommended optimizations
  - **Select All** - Enable every optimization option
  - **Clear All** - Start fresh with no selections
- Or manually select your desired optimizations
- Click "Generate My Optimizer"
- 3 files download automatically:
  - `Windows_Optimizer.bat` - Interactive launcher
  - `Windows_Optimizer_OneTime.ps1` - Full optimization
  - `Windows_Optimizer_Scheduled.ps1` - Recurring tasks only

### 2. Run the BAT File as Administrator
**Right-click `Windows_Optimizer.bat` > Run as Administrator**

The launcher provides an interactive menu:
- [1] Run optimization now (executes OneTime script)
- [2] Schedule recurring maintenance (sets up scheduled tasks)
- [3] View last log file
- [4] View startup programs report
- [5] Restore previous settings
- [6] Exit

**Never run `.ps1` files directly** - always use the .bat launcher!

```
[1] Run One-Time Optimization Now
    - Runs all selected optimizations immediately
    - Creates backup and restore point
    - Generates detailed log and reports

[2] Schedule Recurring Maintenance
    - Choose frequency: Daily/Weekly/Monthly
    - Set execution time (0-23 hours)
    - Only runs tasks that benefit from repetition
    - Runs silently in background

[3] View Last Optimization Log
    - Opens the most recent log file
    - Shows what was cleaned and optimized

[4] View Startup Programs Report
    - Opens HTML report in browser
    - Shows all startup programs with recommendations

[5] Restore Previous Settings
    - Lists all available restore points
    - Reverts changes from a specific optimization run

[6] Exit
```

### 3. Automatic Admin Elevation
The launcher automatically requests administrator privileges - no manual "Run as Admin" needed!

## Safety Features

### Backup System
Every optimization run creates:
- **Backup JSON**: Original registry/service settings
- **Restore Script**: One-click restoration of previous state
- **Detailed Log**: Complete record of all actions taken

### Smart Task Separation
- **One-Time Tasks**: Privacy settings, service configs, performance tweaks
- **Recurring Tasks**: Only temp cleanup and maintenance tasks
- **Prevention**: Settings won't be repeatedly changed by scheduled tasks

## Complete Workflow

```
1. Generate Your Optimizer (index.html)
   - Downloads 3 files:
     - START_HERE_Windows_Optimizer.bat - RUN THIS!
     - Windows_Optimizer_OneTime.ps1 (auto-used)
     - Windows_Optimizer_Scheduled.ps1 (auto-used)

2. Run Launcher (START_HERE_Windows_Optimizer.bat) - RIGHT-CLICK > RUN AS ADMIN
   - Checks for admin privileges
   - Verifies PS1 files are present
   - Shows interactive menu

3. Choose from Menu:
   - [1] Run Optimization Now
     - Executes Windows_Optimizer_OneTime.ps1
     - Creates backup (if enabled)
     - Shows progress in real-time
     - Saves log to script folder
   
   - [2] Schedule Recurring Maintenance
     - Executes Windows_Optimizer_Scheduled.ps1
     - Choose: Daily/Weekly/Monthly
     - Set time (0-23 hours)
     - Choose: Hidden/Visible window
     - Creates Windows scheduled task
   
   - [3] View Last Log
     - Opens most recent WinOptimizer_*.log in Notepad
   
   - [4] View Startup Report
     - Opens StartupPrograms_*.txt in Notepad
   
   - [5] Restore Previous Settings
     - Lists all RESTORE_*.ps1 files
     - Runs selected restore script
     - Shows results
   
   - [6] Exit
```

**KEY RULES**: 
- WARNING: Keep all 3 files in the same folder
- WARNING: Only run START_HERE_Windows_Optimizer.bat as Administrator
- WARNING: Never run .ps1 files directly - they're used automatically!

## ⚙️ Advanced Usage

### Manual Script Execution
If you prefer not to use the launcher:

```powershell
# One-time optimization
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Windows_Optimizer_[timestamp].ps1"

# Or with admin check
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"Windows_Optimizer_[timestamp].ps1\"'"
```

### Custom Scheduling
The launcher creates tasks via `schtasks`, but you can also use Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc) for advanced options.

## 🛡️ Security

- All scripts are generated locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Source code is fully visible and auditable
- Creates backups before any changes
