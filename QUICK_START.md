## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Script won't run"
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Admin, then:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\YourScript.ps1
```

**Solution:**
- Files might be in use → Restart and run again
- Try Safe Mode for deep cleaning
- Check script output for errors

### "I want to undo changes"
**Solution:**
1. Run the restore script (privacy/performance optimizations)

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Create a "Windows Optimization" Folder
```
C:\WindowsOptimization\
  ├── index.html (the portal)
  ├── optimizer.js (the generator)
  ├── Scripts\
  │   ├── TempCleaner_2024-11-23.ps1
  │   ├── Privacy_Optimize.ps1
  │   ├── Privacy_Restore.ps1
  │   └── ...
  └── Logs\
      └── (cleanup logs go here)
```

Keep everything organized!

### Tip 2: Bookmark the Portal
Add `file:///C:/WindowsOptimization/index.html` to your browser bookmarks for quick access.

### Tip 3: Create Desktop Shortcuts
Right-click downloaded scripts → Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)
Right-click shortcut → Properties → Advanced → Run as administrator ✅

### Tip 4: Use Preview Mode First
Always test with preview/dry-run mode before actual cleanup. See what would happen without risk.

### Tip 5: Keep Restore Scripts
When you optimize privacy/performance, download BOTH the optimize and restore scripts. Store them together.
